# rechtschreibung
A little Python app to be used with Pythonista to test different rule sets for German spelling.

## Requirements

You need to have Pythonista installed on iOS.

## Basic Functionality

This project allows you to test different combinations of German spelling rules with a simple GUI. Each change of rules is immediately reflected in a text especially written for this purpose. The GUI can be used to store favorite combinations and compare them.

## Installation

The source code is available as a self-extracting Python script. See file `build/rechtschreibung_zip.py`. Download this file and follow the instructions contained therein.

Have fun!
